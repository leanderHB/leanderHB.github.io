Title: Stability and Interaction of Patterns formed in Conserved Reaction Diffusion Equations.
Leander Post - 14060957

## Topic
In a class of ecological models, it makes sense to study reaction diffusion systems that conserve some quantity, the total mass. These systems are nice to study, since their conservation makes analysis easier/doable at all. This leads us to study the simplest of these systems, equation with two components:
<div>\[\begin{aligned}
U_t &= \epsilon^2\Delta U + f(U,V)\\
V_t &= \Delta V - f(U,V)\\
\end{aligned}\]</div>
For as general a class of reaction terms $$f(U,V)$$ as possible, I will try to study the stability of the patterns that arise from these models. I'll start of with showing the existence of non-uniform steady patterns, the simplest of which is the front- or mesa-solution: with plateaus on either side of a transition. Then I'll go on to prove when these patterns are stable (in the sense of linear stability, which we'll prove implies general stability). When this is done, I'll put my attention on what happens if two fronts are near each-other, diving into the theory of local structures. The question will be if there is any way to predict if these will move together, move apart or perhaps prefer a certain distance between each-other and end up there. Ideally I would like to find if we can forget about the shape of the fronts and find a kind of "force" between the fronts. 
If all this goes well, I will expand this theory to radial systems, possibly in arbitrary dimension, but probably just for 2D to start with, and first study the stability of radial patches and afterwards put two of those together to see if a similar theory can be found for attraction/repulsion. Literature suggests that the radius of curvature is important for the movement of 2D systems (akin to surface tension in other phase-separated systems), so I will study this as a first avenue.

## Supervisors
- Prof.dr. Arjen Doelman, Leiden University (A&DS), will be my daily supervisor. He came up with the project, and he is the most involved in this project. I'll try to meet biweekly with him. I'll discuss the trajectory of this thesis with him mostly. 
- Prof.dr. Ale Jan Homborg, UvA (KdVI), will be my mathematics supervisor. I will have monthly meetings with him. These will most likely happen in Leiden, since he is there one day a week, which makes it such that we can meet with Arjen as well.
- Dr. Mazi Jalaal, UvA, (IoP), will be my physics supervisor. Two people in his team are doing similar things with pattern formation in ecosystems. I'll try to be at the UvA once a week to have some people to discuss physics with. We've agreed that we meet when deemed necessary. 

## Planning
72 ECTS is more than 2000 hours, so this definitely is subject to change. But I'll start with mostly literature research, reading papers in the field. So far I am planning to study "singular geometric perturbation theory", since $$\epsilon^2$$ will become small at some point. Also I'll expand my knowledge on "Sturm-Liouville theory". I will also try to employ the Evans function to study the stability and tie it together with Fenichel theory, which will make the perturbation rigorous. For the interactions, I will look at different kinds like strong, semi-strong and weak interactions, and will likely settle on studying the weak interactions. 
While researching the literature, I'll try to formulate the results in a way that makes sense for my context. Also where possible, I'll use numerics to generate images of the problem at hand, which will be there for the final paper and my own intuition. 
So very roughly: Literature research until september, results etc until may, writing the report until the end.
