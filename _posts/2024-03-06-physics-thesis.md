# Summary
- Find second reviewer is a staff member of the VU and/or UvA Faculty of Science that is _not_ directly involved with the research project.

- Prepare a description of a proposed research project, in consultation with your supervisor and the examiner. Make clear agreements with your supervisor on how often you meet, and what is expected for these meetings and document this in the research proposal.
- The proposal should be registered in datanose **within six weeks after the start of the project**. The track coordinator and the examiner evaluate and have to approve this proposal. Without approval the project cannot be completed.

- Your final presentation is a defense of the whole project. The duration is discussed with your PI. Typically, it is between 30 and 60 minutes, including at least 10 minutes of discussion.

- The final version of the thesis must be uploaded into datanose at least 10 working days before the end of the academic year. This is the version that will be assessed by

- The final grade is rounded to an integer or half-integer, with the exception of a 5.5.
- For the assessment of the Research Project the judgement of a reviewer is included, who pays particular attention to the structure and quality of the report and the presentation. The daily supervisor may attend the assessment and may provide input to the examiner for the evaluation.

### AI
- Using AI tools to improve sentence structure, grammar, spelling, and style.
- Using AI tools to assist with literature reviews and data analysis, with the guidance and feedback of your project supervisor.

What is prohibited:
- Intro/Conclusion
- Using AI tools to generate any portions of your thesis from scratch.
- Using AI tools to manipulate or falsify data or results in any way.

- Be transparent about your use of AI tools in your research, and clearly identify any outputs generated with the help of AI.
- Try to ensure that, to the best of your knowledge, any data used to train AI models is obtained legally and ethically, and that the data is representative and unbiased.
- Use AI outputs to enhance your own understanding and creativity, rather than relying on them exclusively.
- Be aware of the limitations and potential biases of AI technologies, and seek out multiple perspectives and feedback to ensure the accuracy and validity of your work.

# Start of the project

Before the start of the research project

-find a topic. If you need help with this, ask your track coordinator. See the track specific pages for details of when and how to find your project.

-Once you have a project, discuss with your supervisor who will be the examiner, the second reviewer and the daily supervisor. The examiner is a staff member of the VU or UvA Faculty of Science, appointed by the Examinations Board. If needed, a new examiner from an Amsterdam institute can be proposed. The second reviewer is a staff member of the VU and/or UvA Faculty of Science that is _not_ directly involved with the research project.

-Prepare a description of a proposed research project, in consultation with your supervisor and the examiner. Make clear agreements with your supervisor on how often you meet, and what is expected for these meetings and document this in the research proposal.

-Fill out the proposal in datanose (either **[https://datanose.nl/#yourprojects](https://datanose.nl/#yourprojects)**

**[Links to an external site.](https://datanose.nl/#yourprojects)** or **[https://datanose.nl/#DoubleMasterProject](https://datanose.nl/#DoubleMasterProject)** **[Links to an external site.](https://datanose.nl/#DoubleMasterProject)**) The proposal should be registered in datanose **within six weeks after the start of the project**. The track coordinator and the examiner evaluate and have to approve this proposal. Without approval the project cannot be completed.


# About your final presentation and the thesis

-The language of both the report and the presentation is English.

-Your final presentation is a defense of the whole project. The duration is discussed with your PI. Typically, it is between 30 and 60 minutes, including at least 10 minutes of discussion.

-Typically, the presence of the examiner and the reviewer is mandatory.

- If the daily supervisor is not a staff member, they can be asked to provide input for the evaluation of the research, thesis and presentation by the examiner.

-The final version of the thesis must be uploaded into datanose at least 10 working days before the end of the academic year. This is the version that will be assessed by the examiner and the reviewer.

- See the track specific pages for details on the presentation and the thesis.

# About the assessment

The final assessment and scoring will be based on the [rubric](https://canvas.uva.nl/courses/6070/pages/rubric "Rubric") available on Canvas. Various aspects will be scored from insufficient to excellent (on a five point scale). The examiner translates the scores in numerical values for the project work, the thesis and the presentation separately. The final score for the Research Project is an average with a 60% weight for the project work, 30% for the thesis and a 10% weight for the presentation. The final grade is rounded to an integer or half-integer, with the exception of a 5.5.

For the assessment of the Research Project the judgement of a reviewer is included, who pays particular attention to the structure and quality of the report and the presentation. The daily supervisor may attend the assessment and may provide input to the examiner for the evaluation.

# Responsible Use of AI Tools

**Policy Statement on the Responsible Use of AI Tools** **in Master Thesis Writing**

Dear students,

As you begin writing your master thesis, we want to address the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools (like ChatGPT, Bard, etc.) in your work. We believe that the use of AI can be a powerful tool to enhance your writing and research process. However, it is important to use these tools responsibly and with caution.

If you would like to use AI to help with your thesis-writing, it is permitted with certain restrictions/guidelines which we list here. Most importantly, if students wish to use these tools to aid writing, we encourage them to come up with the first version of the thesis draft themselves, before feeding it to AI tools for improving sentences for grammar, spelling, and style. This will help you to maintain control over the content of your thesis and ensure that it reflects your ideas and understanding.

However, we discourage the use of AI tools for introduction and discussion chapters. These sections require a higher level of scientific expertise and accuracy. It is widely acknowledged that the current AI technologies have accuracy concerns, such as providing wrong scientific answers or generating non-existing references to simulate the appearance (but not the substance) of a scientific text. Therefore, we recommend that you seek the advice and feedback of your project supervisors. If mistakes caused by the AI’s inaccuracy were found, the student would be considered entirely responsible.

To summarize, we have established the following guidelines for the use of AI tools in your thesis writing:

What is allowed:

- Using AI tools to improve sentence structure, grammar, spelling, and style.
- Using AI tools to assist with literature reviews and data analysis, with the guidance and feedback of your project supervisor.

What is prohibited:

- Using AI tools to generate any portions of your thesis from scratch.
- Using AI tools to manipulate or falsify data or results in any way.

Note the list of prohibited items above is not exhaustive but demonstrates a few representative examples. We rely on your academic honesty. Besides these rules, we strongly recommend that, together with your project supervisor, you discuss and incorporate into your work the following general guidelines for responsible and ethical use of AI:

- Be transparent about your use of AI tools in your research, and clearly identify any outputs generated with the help of AI.
- Try to ensure that, to the best of your knowledge, any data used to train AI models is obtained legally and ethically, and that the data is representative and unbiased.
- Use AI outputs to enhance your own understanding and creativity, rather than relying on them exclusively.
- Be aware of the limitations and potential biases of AI technologies, and seek out multiple perspectives and feedback to ensure the accuracy and validity of your work.

Remember that your thesis is a reflection of your skills, knowledge, and expertise as a researcher. It is important to use AI tools in a responsible and reflective manner, taking into account their strengths and limitations. If you have any questions or concerns about the use of AI in your thesis, please do not hesitate to discuss them with your project supervisors or with your Track Coordinator.
