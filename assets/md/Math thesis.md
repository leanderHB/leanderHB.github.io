# Summary
- Your supervisor must be a so-called examiner for the Master Project Mathematics, which is a person appointed as such by the Examinations Board. 
- find a suitable independent second reviewer who:
	- should in no way take part in the project: independence;
	- must be an examiner for the Master Project Mathematics as well;
	- gets your Master Thesis two weeks before the Final Presentation;
	- independently grades this thesis and this presentation.

- The third thing to do is to plan your so-called midterm presentation at the Master Seminar of your specialization. 
- This is a presentation about your project in one of the above seminars. Of course, the requirements for this presentation are compatible with being only halfway. The presentation will count for 5% in your final mark.
 - It is not important exactly when you give this presentation. But it is important that you make the appointment with the Master Seminar Coordinator way in advance, as there will be many more candidates, So, timely planning is important.

given by Prof. Jo Ellis-Monaghan in the first two months of the spring semester

[5] The last thing to do is:

- Plan your Final Presentation and Master Project Assessment 

These two items come as a package-deal, and require some planning. This planning should be administrated in DataNose, which asks for confirmations of all players:

- find a time and date on which supervisor and second reader can be present;
- upload the final version of your Master Thesis at least two weeks before the Final Presentation;
- this version will be assessed and you will not be allowed to correct it anymore;

Concerning the Final Presentation itself:

- make a reservation for a KdVI seminar room at the KdVI secretariat 
- supervisor and independent second reader must be present at the presentation;
- it should take 45 minutes, plus 15 minutes for questioning;
- it must always be in English even if everyone present speaks Dutch;
- it must be on the level of fellow students in your specialization;
- hence, do not be tempted to adapt to the level of (lay-)visitors (family, friends);
- you are free to choose your media (blackboard only, slides, etc) but this choice will be assessed.

After the presentation, your supervisor and independent second reader will together assess and grade you Master Project within DataNose. A member of the Examinations Board must be notified of the defence, and may choose to be present to watch over the assessment process but does not assess or grade. 

The assessment criteria are depicted below. Supervisor and Independent Reader assess both the Thesis (50%) and Final Presentation (10%). The section called Attitude and Execution (35%), which contains much more than its title suggests, is only assessed by the Supervisor.

The remaining 5% is for your Midterm Presentation, which is assessed by the Master Seminar Coordinator.

[6] Assuming that your PEP has been approved and your Master Project has been assessed positively, you can now apply for your Master Diploma at the Education Service Center. There you will be informed about the next graduation ceremony.




# All

You typically do your Master Project during your fourth semester. Thus you start it around the same time as when you submit your Study Plan for approval.

[1] The first thing to do is:

- find a suitable supervisor for your project.

Your supervisor must be a so-called examiner for the Master Project Mathematics, which is a person appointed as such by the Examinations Board. The options you can select when administrating your project in DataNose are exactly these examiners. So please register your Master Project as soon as possible to find out if your supervisor is a legal choice (even some KdVI staff members do not know if they are :-))

[Typically all teaching staff at KdVI are on this list. Teaching staff from other universities that you may know from MasterMath are not, and neither is CWI-staff].

Please read the Student Manual on what to do if you insist on a supervisor who is not (yet) an examiner, and note that what you want may not always be possible.

[2] The second thing to do, in consultation with your supervisor, is:

- find a suitable independent second reviewer.

Be prepared that your supervisor may not know that this second reviewer:

- should in no way take part in the project: independence;
- must be an examiner for the Master Project Mathematics as well;
- gets your Master Thesis two weeks before the Final Presentation;
- independently grades this thesis and this presentation.

You also select the name of the independent second reviewer in your Master Thesis portal in DataNose and supply some more details on the project. After submitting, you can start the mathematical work on your project.

[3] The third thing to do is to plan your so-called midterm presentation at the Master Seminar of your specialization.

This is a presentation about your project in one of the above seminars. Of course, the requirements for this presentation are compatible with being only halfway. The presentation will count for 5% in your final mark.

It is not important exactly when you give this presentation. But it is important that you make the appointment with the Master Seminar Coordinator way in advance, as there will be many more candidates, So, timely planning is important.
