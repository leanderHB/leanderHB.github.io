Let's look at the integral a bit more:
$$
\int_{I_f}f_V^* u_0 d\xi
$$
So we've got a certain front, and are interested in this integral. If we don't change the function along $\epsilon^2U^*+ V^*=K^*$, we don't change the front. So a simple thing to do is add:
$$
\hat f = f+M(\epsilon^2 U+V-K^*)
$$
This function will produce the same front, but also:
$$
\hat f_V = f_V+M
$$
So we can tweak the derivative along $\epsilon^2U^*+ V^*=K^*$. One worry we might have, is whether or not this messes with our essential spectrum conditions, and of course, it could. A way to combat that, is to make sure that $M$ has no effect at the plateaus, which we could do by multiplying by $|u_0|=\sqrt{2E-2F(u)}$, which is exponentially small at the plateaus, so in general would have no effect on the derivative at the plateaus. Then we end up with:
$$
\int_{I_f}( f_V+|u_0|M) u_0 d\xi
$$
This integral can be made to have both signs, hence, fronts aren't always stable in these systems!
